                    I started off as a modder for Psych Engine which is a fork of Friday Night Funkin'. I re-modded (more like a reskin now that I think about it) a mod named "An Ammar's Creativity". Turns out, I'm not that good at modding, because I sucked at it. But, I tried my best.
                </p>

                <p>
                    Then, in the same year, I decided to make a website about who I am, what I do, and about my links. I first used netlify to host it and used vanilla html, css. No JavaScript whatsoever.
                </p>

                <p>
                    In the exact same year (again), I made a FNF Engine, forked from Psych Engine! Co-founded with my other friend. I was new to Lua and Haxe coding, and I never knew what I was about to get into.

            </div>
        </Item>

        <Item marginTop="20px">
            <span class="bigText">
                2025
            </span>

            <br />

            <div>
                <p>
                    After a while, I dropped away from the forked engine and decided to learn things.
                </p>

                <p>
                    I decided to remake my website, still with plain HTML and CSS but with more experience with designing and writing. It was really fun! I enjoyed remaking my website with a little more experience.
                </p>
                
                <p>
                    After for some while, I learnt Python. I was new to it, but dang on how easy to make a app or a program or some utility in a few hours or minutes is amazing. I love this programming language but it's just too weird to use it.
                </p>
                
                <p>
                    Then somewhere here n' that. I made my first ever FNF mod that wasn't forked from any other mod. This one used Codename Engine with Haxe because I needed performance and more control over the engine and modding. It was a lot of fun learning Haxe! Codename Engine is a great FNF engine and still would love to use it whenever I make a FNF mod again.

                <p>
                    Out of nowhere, I decided to learn how NodeJS worked. Turns out, it wasn't that hard. I actually enjoy using it and will keep on using it for all my future web projects.
                </p>

                <p>
                    I started to learn more programming languages! Like JavaScript, TypeScript, Bash. It was cool to know more than two programming language, especially when I have terrible memory loss.
                </p>

                <p>
                    I started a open-source forever team! This one is dedicated to making apps for desktop and using python (for now). So far, theres no one. Just one person in the team for now.
                </p>
                
                <p>
                    In late 2025, my friend wanted to make a mod about FNF. I accepted and joined the team. We wanted to make this mod silly, and just not serious whatsoever. After we finished it, we released it on GameBanana and in just about two days... It became popular..? Me and my team were shocked too! The mod is called "FNF KID" if you wanted to check it out.

            <div>
                <p>
                    I'm currently learning more languages! Like C#, Rust, GoLang, Java, and probably more I forgot to mention here.
                </p>

                <p>
                    I've made several open-source projects and apps for just hobby reasons in my personal account and I enjoy making them.
                </p>

                <p>
                    I started to learn about AI and how it works. I thought it was dumb, stupid and would just be a waste of time. But, after a while of using AI (especially Gemini 3.0 Flash), I kinda enjoy coding than before! But, hear me out. Instead of AI just giving me code, I give the AI system instructions and give me a A/B/C/D quiz instead. It's like I have a personal programmer teacher!
                </p>

                <p>
                    I leant some new frameworks! Like React, Vue and SvelteKit. I'm currently using SvelteKit for my website and as my main for future website!
